# What is it?

It's a software that read as an input a string of characters and outputs its binary equivalence to a file.

# How to use it?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zakaria-me/text-to-binary
cd text-to-binary/src
echo "Hello World" > source-text.txt # File to be read as an input
./build main exec
```

During this project I found that good documentation on C is pretty scarce, so here is some suggestion.

[Intro to C](https://www.it.uc3m.es/pbasanta/asng/course_notes/ctut.pdf)

[GNU C Library Reference](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/pdf/libc.pdf)

I recommend going through the GNU C Library Reference when you know exactly what you need, otherwise it's pretty dense and unreadable.
