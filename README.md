# What is it?

It's a software that read as an input a string of characters and give its binary - hexadecimal equivalence. It's basically an hexdump clone.

# How to do it?

I'll be using C.
I know I can probably convert any character to its binary.
I probably also can calculate the offset. And give the number of bytes or bits.

# What to add?

Add a feature to convert binary to Text.
Change the encoding to accomodate non-latin characters?
